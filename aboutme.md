# Overview

First of all, thank you for reading about me. If you haven't, please reach out via LinkedIn. Let's see how we can collaborate. Alright, let me share some areas of my path with you.  

I'm a purpose-driven man. I will learn whatever has to be learned, motivate whoever has to be motivated and be disciplined to execute the vision. No matter how long it takes, I will find a way to accomplish the goal. Moreover, I can thrive in startup (chaotic) environments. I'm able to develop creative strategies, going around walls (restrictions). And I'm not afraid of big changes, even if it means throwing weeks of work to the garbage, becasue the learning stays. 

I'm a business administration and entrepreneurship student at Tec de Monterrey (GPA 4.0). I love technology. I saw the COVID-19 lockdown as an opportunity to dig deeper into Data Science. Since I don't have a technical background, I'm learning it on my own. 

## Background

I'm blessed that a lot of people have believed and invested on me. I'm confident that I will do at least the same for others. 
*   In 2016, I got a full-tuition univerity scholarship from an entrepreneur from Silicon Valley. 
*   In 2016, I got a scholarship for the TrepCamp Program. Where I got my first expousure to tech trends. 
*   In 2016, along with my brother, we were responsible for leading a team on a crowdfunding campaign to collect 400 blankets for children who live in poor conditions.
*   In 2017, I got to be part of the Student Government group at my university. I was responsible for allocating sponsorships for events that benefitted the 14,000 students on campus. 
*   In 2019, I was choose, with only three other students, to be part of the Innovators for the Americas program at ITESM. We had a program kickoff in Maimi and a final pitch in Santiago, Chile. 
*   In 2019, I used part of my savings to spend a month in Silicon Valley without knowing anyone or any meetings. Just to get to know the ecosystem and meet entrepreneurs and tech executives. A mentor helped me get free housing and a car. It was an amazing adventure that made me to be comfortable with risk.
*   I don't walk alone. Amazing mentors have been part of my journey, ranging from entrepreneurs, business executives, university's board members, to professors, and peers. 

## What's comming next

I'm expectant of what's comming next. With the available information, these are my next steps. However, this is only a plan. I understand that new opportunities will come and I have to be flexible enough to consider them.
