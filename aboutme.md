# Overview

First of all, thank you for reading about me. If you haven't, please reach out via LinkedIn. Let's see how we can collaborate. Alright, let me share some areas of my path with you.  

I'm a purpose-driven man. I will learn whatever has to be learned, motivate whoever has to be motivated and be disciplined to execute the vision. No matter how long it takes, I will find a way to accomplish the goal. Moreover, I can thrive in startup (chaotic) environments. I'm able to develop creative strategies, going around walls (restrictions). And I'm not afraid of big changes, even if it means throwing weeks of work to the garbage, becasue the learning stays. 

I'm a business administration and entrepreneurship student at Tec de Monterrey (GPA 4.0). I love technology. I saw the COVID-19 lockdown as an opportunity to dig deeper into Data Science. Since I don't have a technical background, I'm learning it on my own.

*   With only three other students, I got to be part of the Innovators for the Americas program at ITESM. We had a program kickoff in Maimi and a final pitch in Santiago, Chile. 
*   I'm comfortable with risk. I used part of my savings to spend a month in Silicon Valley without knowing anyone or any meetings. Just to get to know the ecosystem and meet entrepreneurs and tech executives. A mentor helped me get free housing and a car. It was an amazing adventure. 
*   I don't walk alot. Amazing mentors have been part of my journey, ranging from entrepreneurs, business executives, university's board members, to professors, and peers. 

## What's comming next
