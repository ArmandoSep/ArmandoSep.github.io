# Overview

First of all, thank you for reading about me. If you haven't, please reach out via LinkedIn. Let's see how we can collaborate. 
Alright, let me share some areas of my path with you.  

I'm a purpose-driven man. I will learn whatever has to be learned, motivate whoever has to be motivated and be disciplined to execute the vision. No matter how long it takes, I will find a way to accomplish the goal. Moreover, I can thrive in chaotic environments. 

I'm a business administration and entrepreneurship student at Tec de Monterrey (GPA 4.0). I love technology. I saw the COVID-19 lockdown as an opportunity to dig deeper into Data Science. Since I don't have a technical background, I'm learning it on my own.
